#### Languages

I like Ruby, Groovy and C#, but have but have most experience in the line-noise that is Perl. I'm a big fan of Dependency Injection and will introduce Microsoft Unity into any .NET project at the drop of a hat. Recently, I've been looking at Go, because I haven't started learning a new language for weeks.

It may not be fashionable, but I'm also rather good at SQL. Don't tell anyone.

#### Certifications

I've been an RHCE (RHEL 3) and I suppose I'm still an Oracle PL/SQL Developer Certified Associate (10g).

#### Open Source

I used to do lots of Open Source stuff between 1999 and 2002\. You can find my code in the released versions of [Pure-FTPd](http://www.pureftpd.org/project/pure-ftpd) and [Gnu Privacy Guard](http://www.gnupg.org/)

I also used to have my own public patches for [Cyrus-SASL](http://cyrusimap.web.cmu.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Cyrus_SASL) and [mod_auth_mysql](http://modauthmysql.sourceforge.net/)

I published Perl scripts and some JavaScript and used to supply custom RPMs of some bits and pieces up until about 2006.

Recently I've been pushing modern trivial projects to my [GitHub](https://github.com/nicdoye) account and sundry bits and bobs as [gists](https://gist.github.com/nicdoye)

I'm always thinking about writing a DNS Server, but it never happens. Perhaps I should just write up the design.
