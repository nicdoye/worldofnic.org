#### Bio

I was born in Devon and raised in a small village in Somerset _(both in England)_, before the UNIX timestamp had reached `20,000,000`. I went to the village primary school, a comprehensive school,
a tertiary institution and then the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk).

#### Cancer

While at primary school, I was diagnosed with [Non-Hodgkin 
Lymphoma](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/Pages/Definition.aspx), and after two years of chemo- and radiotherapy, that was it.

#### Cycling

I love riding a road bike. Unforturnately [doxorubucin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin) _(a.k.a. hadriamycin)_ has
restricted the amount of power I can put out, which means I am very slow.

#### Music

I play the guitar badly. There's no medical excuse for this, 
I'm just terrible.

#### Disclaimer

I do not speak for any of my employers - 
past, present or future. 
Nor do I speak for any club, society, trade union, 
political party, religion, co-operative, 
organisation or collective of any sort 
that I am or have been a member of,
or have supported in any way.
