#### Background

I received all my degrees from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/)

*   BSc (hons) Mathematics 1992
*   MSc Symbolic Computation 1993
*   PhD Order Sorted Computer Algebra 1997

#### Areas of research

I'm mainly interested in pure maths, and by chance this has warped into an interest in many of the areas of computer algebra, and from there into the theory of object-oriented type systems

#### Publications

*   [The implementation of various algorithms for permutation groups in the computer algebra system: Axiom (1993)](https://static.worldofnic.org/cdn/ps/research/msc.ps)
*   [Order sorted computer algebra and coercions, 1997](https://static.worldofnic.org/cdn/ps/research/phd.ps)
*   [Automated coercion for Axiom, 1999](http://www.acm.org/pubs/articles/proceedings/issac/309831/p229-doye/p229-doye.pdf)

#### Other stuff I've thought of doing but never have

*   parallel implementations of some group theory algorithms
*   strongly typed computer algebra in Java (or maybe Groovy?)
*   map/reduce in computer algebra systems

#### Open Source Axiom

In 2003 [Axiom](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom/) became available under an open source licence but I still haven't got around to adding anything to it.
